## Intent

`AuthGuard` now compares the requested admin route by path, ignoring any query string or fragment before evaluating the existing capability checks. This closes the client-side bypass for `/export-reports`, `/lock-records`, `/review-data`, and `/manage-subareas` while preserving normal access for allowed admin users.

## Spec traceability

| Scenario / requirement | Implemented? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-admin denied on `/lock-records?x=1` | Yes | Covered by `src/app/guards/auth.guard.spec.ts` query-string deny case |
| Non-admin denied on `/manage-subareas?foo=bar` | Yes | Covered by `src/app/guards/auth.guard.spec.ts` query-string deny case |
| Non-admin denied on `/export-reports?download=1` | Yes | Covered by `src/app/guards/auth.guard.spec.ts` query-string deny case |
| Admin allowed on `/lock-records?fiscal=2024` | Yes | Covered by `src/app/guards/auth.guard.spec.ts` allow case |
| Path matching ignores fragment / multi-param suffixes | Yes | Covered by deny cases for `/review-data?fiscal=2024#summary` and `/manage-subareas?foo=bar&baz=qux` |

## Tests

| Type | Command / path | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | `yarn test-ci --include src/app/guards/auth.guard.spec.ts` | See PR CI / local run |

## Risks & follow-ups

- Client-side route protection is hardened, but backend authorization in `bcparks-ar-api` remains the authoritative control plane.
