## Intent

Raised CloudFront `ViewerCertificate.MinimumProtocolVersion` from `TLSv1` to `TLSv1.2_2021`.

## Spec traceability

| Scenario / requirement | Implemented? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| @R-06.1 Viewer minimum TLS 1.2+ | Yes | `template.yaml` sets `TLSv1.2_2021` |
| Viewer minimum is not TLSv1 | Yes | Static grep on template |

## Tests

| Type | Command / path | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static | grep MinimumProtocolVersion template.yaml | TLSv1.2_2021 |

## Risks & follow-ups

- Post-deploy TLS smoke is residual.

# PR evidence — [RA LOG-002] Raise Keycloak lifecycle log levels

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| PR / branch | copilot/ra-log-002-keycloak-authentication-logging |
| Spec refs | `spec/spec.md` (LOG-002), `spec/features/log-002-keycloak-lifecycle-log-levels.feature` |
| Constitution articles touched | P3, P5, P7, J3, J5 |
| Tasks | TASK-001, TASK-002, TASK-003 |
| Authoring agent | GitHub Copilot Coding Agent |
| Generated | 2026-08-14T17:38:26Z |

## Intent

`KeycloakService` now logs `onAuthError` and `onAuthRefreshError` at `error` level and `onAuthLogout` at `warn` level so those lifecycle events are still visible when debug logging is off. When `preferred_username` is already available, the lifecycle message includes it as a stable identity hint without logging the full token. Local mock auth remains unchanged.

## Spec traceability

| Scenario / requirement | Implemented? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auth error logged at warn/error | Yes | `keycloak.service.ts` now emits `loggerService.error(...)` from `onAuthError` |
| Refresh error logged at warn/error | Yes | `keycloak.service.ts` now emits `loggerService.error(...)` from `onAuthRefreshError` |
| Logout logged at warn/error | Yes | `keycloak.service.ts` now emits `loggerService.warn(...)` from `onAuthLogout` |
| Username hint included when available | Yes | Lifecycle log helper appends `preferred_username` from `getUsername()` |

## Design system & accessibility

No UI changes.

## Tests

| Type | Command / path | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | `yarn test-ci --include src/app/services/keycloak.service.spec.ts` | Passed (8/8) |
| Unit | `yarn test-ci` | Passed (208/208) |

## Risks & follow-ups

- Logs remain client-side only; server-side audit capture is explicitly out of scope for LOG-002.

# PR evidence — [RA AUTHZ-001] Fix AuthGuard bypass via query params on admin routes

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| PR / branch | copilot/ra-authz-001-fix-authguard-bypass |
| Spec refs | spec/features/authz-001-admin-route-guard.feature |
| Constitution articles touched | P5, P7, J3, J5 |
| Tasks | TASK-001, TASK-002, TASK-003 |
| Authoring agent | Tier 2 v3 pipeline (agentic-b) |
| Generated | 2026-08-31 |

## Intent

`AuthGuard` now compares the requested admin route by path, ignoring any query string or fragment before evaluating the existing capability checks. This closes the client-side bypass for `/export-reports`, `/lock-records`, `/review-data`, and `/manage-subareas` while preserving normal access for allowed admin users.

## Spec traceability

| Scenario / requirement | Implemented? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-admin denied on `/lock-records?x=1` | Yes | Covered by `src/app/guards/auth.guard.spec.ts` query-string deny case |
| Non-admin denied on `/manage-subareas?foo=bar` | Yes | Covered by `src/app/guards/auth.guard.spec.ts` query-string deny case |
| Non-admin denied on `/export-reports?download=1` | Yes | Covered by `src/app/guards/auth.guard.spec.ts` query-string deny case |
| Admin allowed on `/lock-records?fiscal=2024` | Yes | Covered by `src/app/guards/auth.guard.spec.ts` allow case |
| Path matching ignores fragment / multi-param suffixes | Yes | Covered by deny cases for `/review-data?fiscal=2024#summary` and `/manage-subareas?foo=bar&baz=qux` |

## Design system & accessibility

| Check | Result |

| DS components used (list) | None — no UI component changes |
| Tokens used (not hard-coded colour) | None — no styling changes |
| BC Sans imported | Unchanged |

## Public-service minimums

Checklist IDs addressed this PR: N/A — no public UI/content change

## Tests

| Type | Command / path | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | `yarn test-ci --include src/app/guards/auth.guard.spec.ts` | See PR CI / local run |
| Acceptance / feature | `spec/features/authz-001-admin-route-guard.feature` via `src/app/guards/auth.guard.spec.ts` | Covered |
| A11y automation | N/A | No UI change |

## Risks & follow-ups

- Client-side route protection is hardened, but backend authorization in `bcparks-ar-api` remains the authoritative control plane.

# PR evidence — [RA LOG-001] Do not dump full configuration to browser console

| Spec refs | `spec/spec.md` (LOG-001), `spec/features/log-001-no-config-console-dump.feature` |

## Intent

Removed `console.log('Configuration:', this.configuration)` from `ConfigService.init()` so runtime configuration values are no longer dumped to browser console at `logLevel === 0`.

## Spec traceability

| Scenario / requirement | Implemented? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No full config dump when logLevel is All (0) | Yes | Verified in `config.service.spec.ts` with `console.log` spy |
| No full config dump when logLevel is not All | Yes | Verified in `config.service.spec.ts` with `console.log` spy |

## Design system & accessibility

# PR evidence — [RA LOG-003] Log authorization failures in AuthGuard

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| PR / branch | copilot/fix/log-003-auth-denial-logging |
| Spec refs | spec/features/log-003-auth-denial-logging.feature |
| Constitution articles touched | J6 |
| Authoring agent | GitHub Copilot Coding Agent |
| Generated | 2026-08-12T22:30:00Z |

## Intent

`AuthGuard` now injects `LoggerService` and emits a `warn`-level log entry before every authorization-failure redirect. Each log entry includes the requested path, the denial reason, and the `preferred_username` identity hint from the session token when available (empty string otherwise). This satisfies LOG-003 (OWASP A09:2021 / CWE-778) without adding any server-side audit endpoint or collecting new personal data beyond what is already in the token.

Additionally, `KeycloakService.getUsername()` is added to expose `preferred_username` for the identity hint.

## Spec traceability

| Scenario / requirement | Implemented? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authenticated but not authorized → warn logged with path + reason | Yes | `auth.guard.ts` logs before `parseUrl('/unauthorized')` |
| Admin-only route denied → warn logged with path + reason | Yes | `auth.guard.ts` logs before each `parseUrl('/')` capability redirect |
| Identity hint (username) included when available | Yes | `keycloak.service.getUsername()` returns `preferred_username` |
| No server-side audit endpoint | Yes | Out of scope; not added |

## Design system & accessibility

No UI changes.

## Tests

| Type | Command / path | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | `yarn test-ci` — `src/app/guards/auth.guard.spec.ts` | Spies assert `logger.warn` called with path + reason for each denial scenario |

## Risks & follow-ups

- Client-side logs are best-effort (browser console); server-side audit is a separate slice.
