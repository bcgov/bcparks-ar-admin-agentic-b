## Intent

`AuthGuard` now compares the requested admin route by path, ignoring any query string or fragment before evaluating the existing capability checks. This closes the client-side bypass for `/export-reports`, `/lock-records`, `/review-data`, and `/manage-subareas` while preserving normal access for allowed admin users.

## Spec traceability

| Scenario / requirement | Implemented? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-admin denied on `/lock-records?x=1` | Yes | Covered by `src/app/guards/auth.guard.spec.ts` query-string deny case |
| Non-admin denied on `/manage-subareas?foo=bar` | Yes | Covered by `src/app/guards/auth.guard.spec.ts` query-string deny case |
| Non-admin denied on `/export-reports?download=1` | Yes | Covered by `src/app/guards/auth.guard.spec.ts` query-string deny case |
| Admin allowed on `/lock-records?fiscal=2024` | Yes | Covered by `src/app/guards/auth.guard.spec.ts` allow case |
| Path matching ignores fragment / multi-param suffixes | Yes | Covered by deny cases for `/review-data?fiscal=2024#summary` and `/manage-subareas?foo=bar&baz=qux` |

## Risks & follow-ups

- Client-side route protection is hardened, but backend authorization in `bcparks-ar-api` remains the authoritative control plane.

# PR evidence — [RA AUTH-001] Enable PKCE (S256) on Keycloak OIDC init

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| PR / branch | copilot/fix/auth-001-pkce-s256 |
| Spec refs | spec/features/auth-001-pkce.feature |
| Constitution articles touched | J6 |
| Authoring agent | GitHub Copilot Coding Agent |
| Generated | 2026-08-12T20:21:00Z |

## Intent

`KeycloakService.init()` now passes `{ pkceMethod: 'S256' }` to the Keycloak JS client for all non-mock sessions, satisfying OAuth 2.0 Security BCP for public OIDC clients (OWASP A07:2021 / CWE-287). Local mock auth (`?localMockAuth=1`) is unaffected — Keycloak `init()` is never called in that path.

## Spec traceability

| Scenario / requirement | Implemented? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real session: Keycloak init uses pkceMethod S256 | Yes | `keycloak.service.ts` line `init({ pkceMethod: 'S256' })` |
| Mock auth: Keycloak init not required | Yes | `resolveLocalMockAuth()` short-circuits before KC init; covered by spec test |

## Design system & accessibility

No UI changes.
